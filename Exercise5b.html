        <br><b><i>Origin of Bicol Express</i></b>
        <br>
        <br>There are stories saying that Bicol express was conceptualized and first cooked by 
        <br>Ms. Cely Kalaw in her Manila restaurant sometime during the late 60’s to the early 70’s. 
        <br>Based on an article written by Angela De Leon entitled Soul Train: The Unlikely Beginnings 
        <br>Of A Beloved Filipino Dish (published in Chile Pepper Magazine last October 2006), 
        <br>Ms. Kalaw toned down the heat on her Taro dish (this could be “Laing”) after receiving complains 
        <br>from some customers. However, she knew that other customers wanted the Taro dish to be hot and spicy 
        <br>so she invented another amazingly spicy hot dish that would best compliment the Taro. Thus, Bicol Express was born.
